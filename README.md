# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Clay Roberts and I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) in Leiden, NL. I earned my PhD at the University of Cambridge in 2023. I'm from northern Vermont and have been studying and working in Europe since 2013.

### ðŸ”¬ Research interests

I'm currently working on the remote sensing of methane and am interested in developing tools to help mitigate climate change.

Previous research interests include exoplanets and protoplanetary discs.
