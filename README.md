# Hi! 👋

My name is Clay Roberts and I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge. My doctoral degree is supported by the Cambridge Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science, which is an interdisciplinary group shared between multiple departments in the physical sciences. I'm from northern Vermont and have been living/working/studying in the UK for nearly 10 years.

### 🔬 Research interests

I'm currently working on the remote sensing of greenhouse gases and am interested in developing tools to help mitigate climate change.

Previous research interests include exoplanets and protoplanetary discs.
